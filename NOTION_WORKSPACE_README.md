```
if(and(dateBetween(prop("Due Date"), now(), "days") < 0, prop("Status") != "Completed"), "🔴 OVERDUE", "")
```

**Estimated Completion Date**:
```
dateAdd(now(), prop("Remaining Hours") / 8, "days")
```

### Template Buttons

   - Database tasks → Backend developer

2. **Auto-set due date**
   - P0 tasks: Due in 3 days
   - P1 tasks: Due in 1 week
   - P2 tasks: Due in 2 weeks

3. **Status notifications**
   - Send Slack message when moved to "In Progress"
   - Send email when moved to "Completed"
   - Alert when task overdue

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: CSV import fails
**Solution**: Create the database first, then use "Merge with CSV"

**Issue**: Properties show as text
**Solution**: Manually change property types after import

**Issue**: Board view doesn't work
**Solution**: Ensure Status is a Select property type

**Issue**: Formulas show errors
**Solution**: Check property names match exactly (case-sensitive)

**Issue**: Tasks aren't sorting correctly
