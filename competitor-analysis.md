## 7. Target Market (Phase 1)

* **Primary:** Israeli buyers & investors exploring foreign markets (Europe, US)
* **Secondary:** Foreign buyers seeking Israeli real estate opportunities
* **Tertiary:** Professionals (lawyers, brokers) seeking digital exposure

---

## 8. Competitive Advantage

* Local trust (Israel-based, Hebrew interface)
* AI-first UX (guided onboarding)
* End-to-end flow (search → financing → professionals → docs → closing)
* Immediate monetization via subscriptions and partner commissions

---

## 9. Key Risks

* Legal & regulatory differences by country
* Integration complexity (banking APIs, e-sign)
* Data privacy & security (GDPR compliance)
* Scaling supply-side (professionals, lenders)

2. Israel’s fintech ecosystem and bilingual culture offer natural positioning.
3. MVP can enter quickly by solving the “multi-tool chaos” problem.
4. Monetize early with **Premium + Lead Fees**, reinvest revenue in AI and automation.
5. Focus early MVP on **Israel → US / Europe corridor** for maximum impact.
